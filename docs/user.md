# User Documentation

Welcome to the User Documentation. Here you'll find any information you need on how to use the Magazine Tool. Feel like something is missing, or found a typo? Go [open an issue on GitHub][issues] and we'll try our best to update the Documentation as soon as possible. Any bugs you found can be [reported there][issues] as well. If you don't quite get GitHub, just shooting us an email at <WebProductionEditTeam@net-a-porter.com> is fine as well.
